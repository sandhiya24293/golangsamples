	//What is Golang
	//Go also known as Golang is an open source, compiled and statically typed programming language created by google.

	//The primary focus of Golang is to make the development of highly available and scalable web apps simple and easy.


	//Why Golang
	//Why would you choose Golang as your service side programming language when there are tonnes of other languages such as python, ruby, nodejs... that do the same job.

	//Here are some of the pros which I found in choosing Go

	//1)	Concurrency is an inherent part of the language. As a result writing multithreaded programs is a piece of cake. This is achieved by Goroutines and channels which we will discuss later in the upcoming tutorials.
	//2)	Golang is a compiled language. The source code is compiled to native binary. This is missing in interpreted languages such as JavaScript used in nodejs.
	//3)	The language spec is pretty simple. The entire spec fits in a page and you can even use it to write your own compiler :)
	//4)	The go compiler supports static linking. All the go code can be statically linked into one big fat binary and it can be deployed in cloud servers easily without worrying about dependencies.

	//** There is no public, private or protected variable as in other languages.

	//EXCERCISE
	//1) How to can  we access a variable/function/field outside of its package?
	//2) what do you mean by Exported and Unexported Fields?
